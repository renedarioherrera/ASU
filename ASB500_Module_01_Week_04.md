# Week 4


# line by line coding


- when would it not be appropriate to use line by line coding?
- the activity of sounding out is different from the analytic activity of coding
- if you were doing line by line, one line might be one topic, other lines might be other lines, without a reliable structure of themes to frame the lines, it may be challenging to reveal inter rater reliable themes


## some examples


- qualitative comaparative analysis
- "keys to the presidency"


## Questions: how to know when to code the entire paragraph or just by line?


- what are coding segments? coding unit of analysis?
- structural coding; divided up by topic
- at the interview level: did this code ever occur during this interview?


## Question is interrater reliability is necessary for publication?


- it depends on the field,
- on the journal,
- on your own standards for scholarly integrity
- you do not need interrater reliability in an exploratory project
- the assumption is that structure exists,
- need interrater reliability assessment if quantifying data and comparison but requires semi structured data
