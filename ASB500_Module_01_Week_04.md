# Week 4: Making Comparisons


## Matrices

- profile matrix: attributes and cases; 2 mode matrices
- proximity matrix: cases and cases; one mode matrix; similarities and differences between cases
- distilling data into profile data display forces you to make full use of data
- you know only what you can display

### Lesson 4 Building blocks of analysis: making comparisons proximity matrices

- a mileage chart is a proximity matrix
- one mode matrix
- similarity or distance matrix
- rows and columns are the same
- the cells show the distance between rows and columns
- example variables, a correlation matrix
- example cases, cells show similarity
- example cases/interviews; how similar is narrative; most similar and least similar
- spark ideas about why patterns exist

### Lesson 4 Building blocks of analysis: making comparisons visualizations

- multi dimensional scaling MDS
- every profile matrix can produce two proximity matrix

### Lesson 4 Building blocks of analysis: making comparisons units of analysis,

- what things are we comparing? define unit of analysis
- which attributes are we using to compare? univariate, bivariate, mulivariate
- how will we measure similaritiesa nd differences? levels of measuresment

#### units of analysis

- who
- what
- often but not always the individual
- whatever fits in the rows of profile matrix is unit of analysis
- in focus group, the group is the unit of analysis

#### which attributes

- whole texts or attributes
- columns in profile matrix are attributes
- which attributes go with which cases
- how many dimensions? univariate, bivariate, or multivariate

### Lesson 4 Building blocks of analysis: making comparisons levels of measurement


#### nonvariable

- text

#### variable

#### nominal

- exhaustive
- exclusive

#### ordinal

- exhaustive
- exclusive
- rank ordered

#### interval / ratio

- exhaustive
- exclusive
- rank ordered
- meaningful distance between values

## Lesson 4 Building blocks of analysis: making comparisons levels of aggregation

### pairwise

- systematically compare each unit to every other
- constant comparison
- technique to identify themes

### within group

- patterns within group

### cross group

- patterns between groups

| Levels of aggregation | Univariate | Bivariate | Multivariate |
| ------------------------ | ----------  | ---------  | ------------- |
| pairwise | I | IV | VII |
| within group | II | V | VIII |
| cross group | III | VI | IX | 


# line by line coding


- when would it not be appropriate to use line by line coding?
- the activity of sounding out is different from the analytic activity of coding
- if you were doing line by line, one line might be one topic, other lines might be other lines, without a reliable structure of themes to frame the lines, it may be challenging to reveal inter rater reliable themes


## some examples


- qualitative comaparative analysis
- "keys to the presidency"


## Questions: how to know when to code the entire paragraph or just by line?


- what are coding segments? coding unit of analysis?
- structural coding; divided up by topic
- at the interview level: did this code ever occur during this interview?


## Question is interrater reliability is necessary for publication?


- it depends on the field,
- on the journal,
- on your own standards for scholarly integrity
- you do not need interrater reliability in an exploratory project
- the assumption is that structure exists,
- need interrater reliability assessment if quantifying data and comparison but requires semi structured data
