# Week 1 Introduction and Identifying Themes

## Introduction

- the less we know; the less structure to impose
- as you learn more impose more and more structure

## Identifying Themes


### 5 building blocks of analysis


1. Identifying themes
2. building and applying codebooks
3. describing themes
4. making comparisons
5. building and testing models


- theme: underlying dimension of meaning or construct, that cuts across a variety of expressions
- broad; gender
- specific; to a culture or specific to a dataset
- what is a theme: what is this an example of? facilitates inductive discovery of themes
- can be broad or narrow
- inductive - open coding / in vivo / exploratory / unstructured ; emerge from the text; close line by line
- deductive - a priori coding / structural / confirmatory / structure ; structural codes


### observational techniques


- 8 different
- "write down a specific description of your most recent cold or flu"
- imagine myself as a medical anthropologist trying to understand emerging diseases
- cold and flu as ethnomedical categories


#### word repetition


- look at how words are repeated
- achy, sore, swallowing,
- what shared categories of experience exist across these conditions?
- basic contours of the phenomenon
- doesn't yield deep meaning,
- identifies fundamental ideas that people circle back to



#### cultural insider categories


- indigenous categories
- not to be confused with metaphor or analogy
- words not easily understood unless they are a cultural insider and understand the cultural context
- for example, christmas vacation; agatha christi book; start to unpack unerlying meeting of rest, relaxation, and waiting, i.e. no sense of urgency


#### metaphors and analogies


- "running down my system"; body as a machine
- "combat initial siege"; disease as foreign invader to fight off


#### transitions


- "i recall..."; "this was related to..."
- recognition of disease onset and progression


#### similarities and differences


- constant comparison; what is shared? what are the differences?
- how do they suggest themes?
- similarities in describing symptoms; what elements of conditions are shared?
- differences? causes of diseases; contextual and social impact


#### linguistic connectors


- words or phrases that indicate attributes or causal relationships
- "because"; if then; taxonomy, time, contingent; spacial
- what is the connecting schema or logic?
- there is some ordering to disease onset,
- confirming significance of sickness
- red flashing arrows indicating a piece of logical progression to further describe


#### missing data


- what was not asked?
- what was not shared?
- information is obvious to a cultural insider and not said out loud
- people will not say because too sensitive, too stigmatized, too personal to share with outsider
- causes of disease and understanding of germ theory
- absence of other people; where is the social support?


#### theory related material


- what analytic concepts or themes are interesting?
- causes, symptoms, treatment, social support
- gender differences?
- gendered ways of speaking


### processing techniques

- 4 different
- processing of primary data; words, insider categories, phrases
- boil down themes to a manageable number
- metatheme identification


#### cutting and sorting


- physically cut up key quotes and sort them to find larger Themes
- useful in the context of multidisciplinary collaboration


#### word lists key words in context analysis


- word frequency list


#### word co occurence


- multidimensional scaling
- find clusters and dimensions


#### metacoding


- use of metathemes allows to capture broad cross cultural pattern and meaning


## Textbook Reading


Citation: Analyzing Qualitative Data: Systematic Approaches. Second Edition. 2017


### Chapter 1


- data are the archaeological record of experience
- 4 main objectives in Qualitative research
- the analysis of Qualitative data
- the Qualitative analysis of data


1. exploration - what kinds of things are present here? how are they related?
2. description - are there natural groups here? what does a case look like? what does a set of cases look like? what does the culture look like?
3. comparison - how is case x different from case y? how are groups of x different from groups of y?
4. testing models - to what degree does a particular case conform to a proposed model?


- 5 kinds of Qualitative data


1. physical objects
2. still images
3. sounds
4. moving images / video
5. texts

- on your own assignments can be submitted for feedback but not required
- yellow highlight are required assignments
- course goal is to learn 6/12 QDA techniques
- green assignments are workshops; intervals for final project feedback
