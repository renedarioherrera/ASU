# Week 1 Introduction and Identifying Themes

## Introduction

- the less we know; the less structure to impose
- as you learn more impose more and more structure

## Identifying Themes


### 5 building blocks of analysis


1. Identifying themes
2. building and applying codebooks
3. describing themes
4. making comparisons
5. building and testing models


- theme: underlying dimension of meaning or construct, that cuts across a variety of expressions
- broad; gender
- specific; to a culture or specific to a dataset
- what is a theme: what is this an example of? facilitates inductive discovery of themes
- can be broad or narrow
- inductive - open coding / in vivo / exploratory / unstructured ; emerge from the text; close line by line
- deductive - a priori coding / structural / confirmatory / structure ; structural codes


### observational techniques


- 8 different
- "write down a specific description of your most recent cold or flu"
- imagine myself as a medical anthropologist trying to understand emerging diseases
- cold and flu as ethnomedical categories


#### word repetition


- look at how words are repeated
- achy, sore, swallowing,
- what shared categories of experience exist across these conditions?
- basic contours of the phenomenon
- doesn't yield deep meaning,
- identifies fundamental ideas that people circle back to



#### cultural insider categories


- indigenous categories
- not to be confused with metaphor or analogy
- words not easily understood unless they are a cultural insider and understand the cultural context
- for example, christmas vacation; agatha christi book; start to unpack unerlying meeting of rest, relaxation, and waiting, i.e. no sense of urgency


#### metaphors and analogies


- "running down my system"; body as a machine
- "combat initial siege"; disease as foreign invader to fight off


#### transitions


- "i recall..."; "this was related to..."
- recognition of disease onset and progression


#### similarities and differences


- constant comparison; what is shared? what are the differences?
- how do they suggest themes?
- similarities in describing symptoms; what elements of conditions are shared?
- differences? causes of diseases; contextual and social impact


#### linguistic connectors


- words or phrases that indicate attributes or causal relationships
- "because"; if then; taxonomy, time, contingent; spacial
- what is the connecting schema or logic?
- there is some ordering to disease onset,
- confirming significance of sickness
- red flashing arrows indicating a piece of logical progression to further describe


#### missing data


- what was not asked?
- what was not shared?
- information is obvious to a cultural insider and not said out loud
- people will not say because too sensitive, too stigmatized, too personal to share with outsider
- causes of disease and understanding of germ theory
- absence of other people; where is the social support?


#### theory related material


- what analytic concepts or themes are interesting?
- causes, symptoms, treatment, social support
- gender differences?
- gendered ways of speaking


### processing techniques

- 4 different
- processing of primary data; words, insider categories, phrases
- boil down themes to a manageable number
- metatheme identification


#### cutting and sorting


- physically cut up key quotes and sort them to find larger Themes
- useful in the context of multidisciplinary collaboration


#### word lists key words in context analysis


- word frequency list


#### word co occurence


- multidimensional scaling
- find clusters and dimensions


#### metacoding


- use of metathemes allows to capture broad cross cultural pattern and meaning


## Textbook Reading


Citation: Analyzing Qualitative Data: Systematic Approaches. Second Edition. 2017


### Chapter 1: Introduction to Text Qualitative Data Analysis


- data are the archaeological record of experience
- 4 main objectives in Qualitative research
- the analysis of Qualitative data
- the Qualitative analysis of data


1. exploration - what kinds of things are present here? how are they related?
2. description - are there natural groups here? what does a case look like? what does a set of cases look like? what does the culture look like?
3. comparison - how is case x different from case y? how are groups of x different from groups of y?
4. testing models - to what degree does a particular case conform to a proposed model?


- 5 kinds of Qualitative data


1. physical objects
2. still images
3. sounds
4. moving images / video
5. texts


### Chapter 2: Choosing a Topic and Searching the Literature


#### Exploratory and Confirmatory Research


- Exploratory research is what you do early in any research process when you're starting out and trying to understand a research topic.
- Confirmatory research is what you do when you already have a firm idea of the concepts you want to explore and how they are related to each other. Often begins by hypothesis testing.


- The Research Process for Text Analysis


1. Data Collection (Crucial for Exploratory Research)
2. Theme identification (Crucial for Exploratory Research)
3. Code Definition (Crucial for Confirmatory Research)
4. Inter-coder reliability (Crucial for Confirmatory Research)
5. Coding
6. Analysis and Write Up



#### Four Questions to Ask About Research Questions


1. Does this topic really interest me?
2. Is this a problem that is amenable to empirical inquiry?
3. Do I have the resources I need to investigate this topic at the level of detail that I need to be confident about results? Do I have the resources to study this population at this particular research site? To use this particular data collection method?
4. Will my research question, or the methods I want to use, or the population I want to study involve unresolvable ethical problems?


#### Role of Theory in Social Research


- different paradigms produce different answers to the same question
- a lot of really interesting questions may have answers that are generated from several paradigms


#### Choosing a Research Question


1. internal states; attitudes, beliefs, preferences
2. external states; characteristics such as age, wealth, health status
3. behavior; what people eat, who they communicate with, reported and actual behavior
4. artifacts; includes physical residue of human behavior
5. environment; characteristics of physical, biological, and social environments in which people live
6. biological variables; blood pressure, body mass index


#### The Literature Search


- All you need are a few key references to start. If you know the name of just one author whose work should be cited by anyone working in a particular field you can find out who cited that author and where. You can search the literature forward in time


#### Databases for Searching the Literature


- google scholar
- citation indexes
- annual review
- ERIC
- NTIS
- pubmed
- psycinfo
- sociological abstracts
- proquest dissertations and theses databases
- lexisnexis
- oclc


### Chapter 5: Finding Themes


- Analyzing text involves 5 tasks:
1. discovering themes and subthemes
2. describing core and peripheral elements of themes
3. building heirarchies of themes or codebooks
4. applying themes; i.e. attaching them to chunks of actual text
5. linking themes into theoretical models  
- there are two  kinds of themes
1. induced themes come from data
2. a priori themes come from prior research
- cutting and sorting expressions into piles is the most versatile technique for finding major themes, subthemes, and even metathemes


#### What's a Theme


In every culture are found a limited number of dynamic affirmations, called themes, which control behavior or stimulate activity. The activities, prohibitions of activities, or references which result from the acceptance of a theme are its expressions; the expressions of a theme aid us in discovering it


#### Where do Themes Come From


- induced themes come from data
- a priori (deduced themes) themes come from prior understanding
- act of discovering themes is called open coding


#### Eight Observational Techniques: Things to Look For


1. repetitions
2. indigenous typologies or categories
3. metaphors and analogies
4. transitions
5. similarities and differences
6. linguistic connectors; causal relations, conditional relations, taxonomic relations, time oriented relations, x is y relations, contingent relations, spatial relations, operational definitions, example definitions, comparison definitions, class inclusions, synonyms, antonyms, provenience, circularity
7. missing data
8. theory related material


#### Four Manipulative Techniques: Ways to Process Text


1. cutting and sorting; identifying quotes or expressions that seem somehow important and then arranging into piles of things that go together
2. word lists and key words in context (KWIC); data condensation, data distillation, concordance,
3. word co occurrence; collocation, semantic network analysis,
4. metacoding


#### Selecting Among Techniques


- five things to consider in selecting a technique


1. kind of data?
2. skill
3. labor
4. number and types of themes to be generated
5. test the reliability and validity of themes produced?

# Week 2: Describing Themes


## Video Lecture


- A very well designed codebook can take you very far.
- the way you write about the themes is important as the analysis
- ladder of analytical abstraction
- summarize and package; repackage and aggregate; develop and test propositions to construct explanatory framework


### levels of description


- themes
- cases
- groups;
- cultures; shared knowledge or perspectives
-


### characteristics of good description


- range; one extreme to another
- central tendency;
- distribution;
- details; important to ethnographer, verbatim quotes; what the detail really feels like
- context; relevant social cultural political economic ecological details


### strategic decisions


- themes and context
- cases and range, central tendency, distribution
- cultures and range, central tendency, distribution, details, context

### presentation


#### general and particular


- universal statements
- cross cultural assertions
- general statements about society or cultural group


#### core and periphery


- range
- central tendency
- distribution
- context


#### Style


- direct quotes
- paraphrases
- exemplary cases
- composites and vignettes


## Live Q & A 1 Sep 2020

### Syllabus

- pick one skill or assignment and have that be the grade


### Notes

- critical response process; solicit maker feedback; https://lizlerman.com/critical-response-process/
- will adopt in this class; enthusiastic to try;
- have found that people are experiencing much distress and are less open to hear critical feedback
- in our role, we would be responder (maker, responder, facilitator)
- feedback sandwich compared to the feedback tostada
- coding, unspoken and underlying meanings, can be challenging to reliable coding


### bibliographic software & literature review

## Sandelowski, Margarete. “Writing a Good Read: Strategies for Re‐presenting Qualitative Data.” Research in Nursing & Health 21, no. 4 (August 1998): 375–382.

- there is no style for Qualitative reporting
- the representation should best fit the Research
- state the point, in one sentence
- how to balance description, analysis, and interpretation
- emphasize character scene or plot
- determine point of voice/voice
- understand and use metaphor well
- consider using time as an organizing primary or secondary principle
- time from the perspective of the research subject compared to the perspective of the researcher
- time related rhetorical devices, such as flash backs or flash forwards
- organize according to central tendencies and ranges


## Saldaña, Johnny. “Dramatizing Data: A Primer.” Qualitative inquiry 9, no. 2 (2016): 218–236.

- ethnotheatre as an appropriate choice for qualitative research
- plot is the overall structure of the play
- the story line is the sequential arrangement of units within the plot
- should have a beginning, middle, and end but not necessarily in that order
- reduction of field notes to salient foreground issues
- promote a three dimensional portrayal of the participant, from interviews, field notes, observations, research literature,
- interviews generate transcript data suitable for transformation into one person reflections.
- dialogue shows character interaction and interplay


# Week 3: Building and Applying Codebooks


# check in


- https://anthroillustrated.com/
- put questions in the chat


# questions


question 1: describing themes;


- line by line is difficult and may not yield analytic categories as quickly
- the techniques describing memoing are advanced


question 2: problem


- design a semi structured protocol
- deductively determined
- then go back and code elicited data (example about discipline)
- not optimal because 1 - you put the idea into their head
- and 2 - there is no variability
- a semi structured protocol already frames the data
- the big point is to describe and theorize variability
- how then to use deductive or inductive codes to capture?
- inductive, use their own words to form categories
- deductive, put their words into predetermined existing categories
- for us to deduce narratives from the inductive perspective, the researcher must be linguistically and culturally competent
- aim for deductive variability; understand the data


question 3: why do some researchers lack qualitative competence


- quantitative analysis of qualitative data is limited in explaining the meaning of what people were saying
- although it is accurate and reliable
- in anthropology training, very often the training is to specified; and so the toolkit is too narrow to use effectively in a broad range of situations


question 4: coding assignment week 2


- theme tree;


question 5: saldana reading


## Chapter 6 of Analyzing Qualitative


### Three Kinds of Codes

1. structural: describe things like features of the environment in which data are collected, features of ther espondent, features of the interview, etc
2. thematic: show where the themes we've identified actually occur in text
3. memos: field notes about codes and contain our running commentary as we read through text

### Building codebooks


#### 5 step for developing themes inductively


1. reduce raw data
2. identify themes
3. compare themes
4. create codes
5. assess interrater reliability


#### 3 step for developing themes deductively

1. create a code
2. review the data and revise the code
3. assess interrater reliability


### Using Existing Codes


adapting from preexisting coding sources


### applying theme codes to text

3 meanings to the word code in English

1. code names and places to protect our respondents' anonymity
2. tag or index the text or to assign it values of a scale; themes as an index code or a tag
3. theme as a value code, for example no pain, low pain, mid, high.


### mechanics of marking text


1. start any text analysis project with pencil and paper methods; writing notes in the margins, highlighting chunks of text with different colors, and cutting and sorting multiple copies of notes and transcripts
2. do with a few pages or several interviews to get a feel of the data
3. as you write down each code on a first pass through a text, circle or highlight the exact chunk of text to which it refers


### using text analysis software


- for simple projects a word processor is all that is needed


### multiple coders


- intercoder reliability is vital if you're going to do statistical analysis on your data


### Training coders


1. give all coders a written codebook to which they can refer during the actual marking of data
2. after reviewing the codebook as a group, have coders independently code a set of real examples
3. review their respones and bring the group together to discuss and resolve discrepancies
4. update the codebook as coders come to agreements about the content of themes
5. once coders start coding the bulk of the data, do random spot checks to keep coders alert and to find out if they are running into situations that you had not anticipated in designing the codebook
6. if there are continued problems, repeat steps 3 & 4, if you make any changes, go back over previously coded m aterial to make sure it is all coded consistently


### how many coders are enough?


1. coders' experience / knowledge
2. core / periphery dispersion of the theme. clear core is easy.
3. level of inference required to see a theme. the more inference it takes the harder it is for two or more to agree that they see it in a text
4. number of times that any given theme appears in the text. more rare and more important the more coders needed to look for it.
5. consensus among coders about the presence of a theme


### Trimming codes and coders


reduce workload and cost by:


1. lowering the number of codes
2. reducing the amount of text to be coded
3. using fewer coders


### content of codebooks

key to good coding is a good codebook

1. mnemonic; explicit and in plain language
2. emic and etic themes;
3. short descriptions and detailed descriptions;
4. list of inclusion and exclusion criteria;
5. typical and atypical examples

### describing themes

provide an overview of the theme and core components.

### finding typical segments of text


use the pile sort method;
begin by retrieving all instance of a theme, cutting out the quotes, and writing some identifier on the back;
then sort them;


1. first spread out quotes on large table all mixed up
2. examine the quotes and identify those that seem to represent the core aspects of the theme then move it toward the middle of the table; once finished, core quotes at the center, peripheral out towards the edge
3. refine. sort core quotes into two groups 1- most representative and 2-less representative. then express in words the characteristics that distinguish between quotes in the strong and week core. this identifies primary and secondary components
4. sort periphery into groups based on similarity. make as many groups as necessary
5. select typical quotes or exemplars. select a couple that seem to best represent the group
6. with the quotes on the table sorted into core and periphery, turn each one over and examine who said it. this keeps you from using just one or two informants as the sources. if there is a pattern in the distribution you'll likely see it

ASU ASB 500 Module 1 Week 3:

Building and applying codebooks video 3 working with multiple coders


5 benefits


- reliability: agreement among coders indicates which codes are instruments, apply the data in the same way
- validity; defends trustworthiness of analysis, can defined in ways that are meaningful to others,
- theme definition; clarify meaning and establish inclusion and exclusion criteria


video 4: measuring intercoder reliability


- percent agreement; cohen's kappa: measures agreement beyond chance
- calculate with a coder by coder agreement matrix
- kappa = (p1 - p2) / (1-p2)
- report kappa calculation for each code in codebook,
- report confidence intervals and standard error along with kappa statistic
- kappa ranges from -1 to 1
- preferred to see kappa >= .8
- "kappa calculator" such as graphpad quick calcs


- assessing intercoder reliability early is a strategy to identify problems with coder training or with conceptual clarity of codebook
- later it demonstrates final agreement


how many codes?

- be aware of code creep
- build codebooks for what you need
- limit codes to what fits on a single page
- 30-50 codes is usually about right


how many levels?

- maybe no more than 3, or 5


- codebooks specify project level coding instructions
- how to code, who to code, what to code, where to code


summary

- coding is heart and soul of text analysis
- structured codebook is key to systematic analysis
- using multiple coders improves validity and identifies core periphery structures


text: MacQueen, Kathleen M., Eleanor McLellan, Kelly Kay, and Bobby Milstein. "Codebook development for team-based qualitative analysis." Cam Journal 10, no. 2 (1998): 31-36.


codebook structure:

five parts to codebook:

1. code mnemonic
2. brief definition
3. full definition of inclusion criteria
4. full definition of exclusion criteria to explain how the code differed from others
5. example passages that illustrated how the code concept might appear in natural language


6 components to a codebook:


1. the code
2. brief definition
3. full definition
4. guidelines for when to use the code
5. guidelines for when not to use the code
6. examples


a relational database is well suited for both maintaining the structure and supporting the process



# Week 4


# line by line coding


- when would it not be appropriate to use line by line coding?
- the activity of sounding out is different from the analytic activity of coding
- if you were doing line by line, one line might be one topic, other lines might be other lines, without a reliable structure of themes to frame the lines, it may be challenging to reveal inter rater reliable themes


## some examples


- qualitative comaparative analysis
- "keys to the presidency"


## Questions: how to know when to code the entire paragraph or just by line?


- what are coding segments? coding unit of analysis?
- structural coding; divided up by topic
- at the interview level: did this code ever occur during this interview?


## Question is interrater reliability is necessary for publication?


- it depends on the field,
- on the journal,
- on your own standards for scholarly integrity
- you do not need interrater reliability in an exploratory project
- the assumption is that structure exists,
- need interrater reliability assessment if quantifying data and comparison but requires semi structured data


# Week 6

# Week 5: models


- typically people come to qual analysis is to create a model
- any research can be phrased as a research question
- exploratory model, what are the distinguishing characteristics of the question
- Or confirmatory?
- "how does this model play out"
- but hypotheses, found only in confirmatory, is a model because ...
- a research question is a model because it lays out relationship for a set of relationships
- research question, hypotheses, model, description are all the same
- the preceeding vary in stylization of phenomenon
- to demystify, must think about theory building in this way
- theorizing is a plebian activity, that every single person does, every person has a schema, a way of knowing how the world works
- theorizing is not an elite activity


# questions about models, research questions, hypotheses?


## how questions ask about processual models; what's the process? need longitudinal data, research data over time?


- must then plan on collecting longitudinal data
- alternative to processual/causality, mus
- if you're doing methods, then you must have a question
- different methodological approaches have inherent assumptions
- it is important to understand how to formulate a research questions
- a research question is a model where every single word works
- *in my example, of LTBC webinar research,*
- look to take class, ethnographic field methods?
- research design is like a puzzle, every piece must fit


## data mining


- is an exploratory activity
- be explicit about what you are doing with data mining
- but p value hacking the data to find a significant association should be avoided
- preceeding, is data misconduct
-


## my project: ltbc webinars


1. identifying themes
2. building and applying codebooks

4. making comparisons
5. buildilng and testing models


ASU ASB 500 Notes Week 7: 6 Oct 2020

# traditions of analysis; inductive; schema


- what are the reasons to compel NSF to invest in a study
- 1. concept of phenomenon is not well known
- difficult to take in explicitly inductive research and get grant funding
- 2. not enough literature to build off of, inadequate literature backing
- research question; as a model;
- what is the research question for an inductive study
- if i was doing inductive study what would the research study be
- what is this experience about,
- what is this phenomenon
- and so it is not a compelling question, when in competition with other questions for funding
- 3. questions are too poorly formed to be compelling
- respond to critique by; make compelling argument about why this case may add to what is already known; hitting really hard on the idea that this has not been well explored
- not common for professionals and intellectuals to question the values of the field
- inadequate because of unequal access to theory formation; implications then for what is unknown,
- weird argument; western educated industrial r democratic
