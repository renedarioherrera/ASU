- what are the reasons to compel NSF to invest in a study
- 1. concept of phenomenon is not well known
- difficult to take in explicitly inductive research and get grant funding
- 2. not enough literature to build off of, inadequate literature backing
- research question; as a model;
- what is the research question for an inductive study
- if i was doing inductive study what would the research study be
- what is this experience about,
- what is this phenomenon
- and so it is not a compelling question, when in competition with other questions for funding
- 3. questions are too poorly formed to be compelling
- respond to critique by; make compelling argument about why this case may add to what is already known; hitting really hard on the idea that this has not been well explored
- not common for professionals and intellectuals to question the values of the field
- inadequate because of unequal access to theory formation; implications then for what is unknown,
- weird argument; western educated industrial r democratic

- quantitative analysis; factor analysis; data mining; semantic network analysis;
- funded research has to do something important
- come to inductive research, already informed by the literature; most important
