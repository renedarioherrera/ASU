- the less we know; the less structure to impose
- as you learn more impose more and more structure

## Identifying Themes


### 5 building blocks of analysis


1. Identifying themes
2. building and applying codebooks
3. describing themes
4. making comparisons
5. building and testing models


- theme: underlying dimension of meaning or construct, that cuts across a variety of expressions
- broad; gender
- specific; to a culture or specific to a dataset
- what is a theme: what is this an example of? facilitates inductive discovery of themes
- can be broad or narrow
- inductive - open coding / in vivo / exploratory / unstructured ; emerge from the text; close line by line
- deductive - a priori coding / structural / confirmatory / structure ; structural codes


### observational techniques


- 8 different
- "write down a specific description of your most recent cold or flu"
- imagine myself as a medical anthropologist trying to understand emerging diseases
- cold and flu as ethnomedical categories


#### word repetition


- look at how words are repeated
- achy, sore, swallowing,
- what shared categories of experience exist across these conditions?
- basic contours of the phenomenon
- doesn't yield deep meaning,
- identifies fundamental ideas that people circle back to



#### cultural insider categories


- indigenous categories
- not to be confused with metaphor or analogy
- words not easily understood unless they are a cultural insider and understand the cultural context
- for example, christmas vacation; agatha christi book; start to unpack unerlying meeting of rest, relaxation, and waiting, i.e. no sense of urgency


#### metaphors and analogies


- "running down my system"; body as a machine
- "combat initial siege"; disease as foreign invader to fight off


#### transitions


- "i recall..."; "this was related to..."
- recognition of disease onset and progression


#### similarities and differences


- constant comparison; what is shared? what are the differences?
- how do they suggest themes?
- similarities in describing symptoms; what elements of conditions are shared?
- differences? causes of diseases; contextual and social impact


#### linguistic connectors


- words or phrases that indicate attributes or causal relationships
- "because"; if then; taxonomy, time, contingent; spacial
- what is the connecting schema or logic?
- there is some ordering to disease onset,
- confirming significance of sickness
- red flashing arrows indicating a piece of logical progression to further describe


#### missing data


- what was not asked?
- what was not shared?
- information is obvious to a cultural insider and not said out loud
- people will not say because too sensitive, too stigmatized, too personal to share with outsider
- causes of disease and understanding of germ theory
- absence of other people; where is the social support?


#### theory related material


- what analytic concepts or themes are interesting?
- causes, symptoms, treatment, social support
- gender differences?
- gendered ways of speaking


### processing techniques

- 4 different
- processing of primary data; words, insider categories, phrases
- boil down themes to a manageable number
- metatheme identification


#### cutting and sorting


- physically cut up key quotes and sort them to find larger Themes
- useful in the context of multidisciplinary collaboration


#### word lists key words in context analysis


- word frequency list


#### word co occurence


- multidimensional scaling
- find clusters and dimensions


#### metacoding


- use of metathemes allows to capture broad cross cultural pattern and meaning


## Textbook Reading


Citation: Analyzing Qualitative Data: Systematic Approaches. Second Edition. 2017


### Chapter 1: Introduction to Text Qualitative Data Analysis


- data are the archaeological record of experience
- 4 main objectives in Qualitative research
- the analysis of Qualitative data
- the Qualitative analysis of data


1. exploration - what kinds of things are present here? how are they related?
2. description - are there natural groups here? what does a case look like? what does a set of cases look like? what does the culture look like?
3. comparison - how is case x different from case y? how are groups of x different from groups of y?
4. testing models - to what degree does a particular case conform to a proposed model?


- 5 kinds of Qualitative data


1. physical objects
2. still images
3. sounds
4. moving images / video
5. texts


### Chapter 2: Choosing a Topic and Searching the Literature


#### Exploratory and Confirmatory Research


- Exploratory research is what you do early in any research process when you're starting out and trying to understand a research topic.
- Confirmatory research is what you do when you already have a firm idea of the concepts you want to explore and how they are related to each other. Often begins by hypothesis testing.


- The Research Process for Text Analysis


1. Data Collection (Crucial for Exploratory Research)
2. Theme identification (Crucial for Exploratory Research)
3. Code Definition (Crucial for Confirmatory Research)
4. Inter-coder reliability (Crucial for Confirmatory Research)
5. Coding
6. Analysis and Write Up



#### Four Questions to Ask About Research Questions


1. Does this topic really interest me?
2. Is this a problem that is amenable to empirical inquiry?
3. Do I have the resources I need to investigate this topic at the level of detail that I need to be confident about results? Do I have the resources to study this population at this particular research site? To use this particular data collection method?
4. Will my research question, or the methods I want to use, or the population I want to study involve unresolvable ethical problems?


#### Role of Theory in Social Research


- different paradigms produce different answers to the same question
- a lot of really interesting questions may have answers that are generated from several paradigms


#### Choosing a Research Question


1. internal states; attitudes, beliefs, preferences
2. external states; characteristics such as age, wealth, health status
3. behavior; what people eat, who they communicate with, reported and actual behavior
4. artifacts; includes physical residue of human behavior
5. environment; characteristics of physical, biological, and social environments in which people live
6. biological variables; blood pressure, body mass index


#### The Literature Search


- All you need are a few key references to start. If you know the name of just one author whose work should be cited by anyone working in a particular field you can find out who cited that author and where. You can search the literature forward in time


#### Databases for Searching the Literature


- google scholar
- citation indexes
- annual review
- ERIC
- NTIS
- pubmed
- psycinfo
- sociological abstracts
- proquest dissertations and theses databases
- lexisnexis
- oclc


### Chapter 5: Finding Themes


- Analyzing text involves 5 tasks:
1. discovering themes and subthemes
2. describing core and peripheral elements of themes
3. building heirarchies of themes or codebooks
4. applying themes; i.e. attaching them to chunks of actual text
5. linking themes into theoretical models  
- there are two  kinds of themes
1. induced themes come from data
2. a priori themes come from prior research
- cutting and sorting expressions into piles is the most versatile technique for finding major themes, subthemes, and even metathemes


#### What's a Theme


In every culture are found a limited number of dynamic affirmations, called themes, which control behavior or stimulate activity. The activities, prohibitions of activities, or references which result from the acceptance of a theme are its expressions; the expressions of a theme aid us in discovering it


#### Where do Themes Come From


- induced themes come from data
- a priori (deduced themes) themes come from prior understanding
- act of discovering themes is called open coding


#### Eight Observational Techniques: Things to Look For


1. repetitions
2. indigenous typologies or categories
3. metaphors and analogies
4. transitions
5. similarities and differences
6. linguistic connectors; causal relations, conditional relations, taxonomic relations, time oriented relations, x is y relations, contingent relations, spatial relations, operational definitions, example definitions, comparison definitions, class inclusions, synonyms, antonyms, provenience, circularity
7. missing data
8. theory related material


#### Four Manipulative Techniques: Ways to Process Text


1. cutting and sorting; identifying quotes or expressions that seem somehow important and then arranging into piles of things that go together
2. word lists and key words in context (KWIC); data condensation, data distillation, concordance,
3. word co occurrence; collocation, semantic network analysis,
4. metacoding


#### Selecting Among Techniques


- five things to consider in selecting a technique


1. kind of data?
2. skill
3. labor
4. number and types of themes to be generated
5. test the reliability and validity of themes produced?

# Week 2: Describing Themes


## Video Lecture


- A very well designed codebook can take you very far.
- the way you write about the themes is important as the analysis
- ladder of analytical abstraction
- summarize and package; repackage and aggregate; develop and test propositions to construct explanatory framework


### levels of description


- themes
- cases
- groups;
- cultures; shared knowledge or perspectives
-


### characteristics of good description


- range; one extreme to another
- central tendency;
- distribution;
- details; important to ethnographer, verbatim quotes; what the detail really feels like
- context; relevant social cultural political economic ecological details


### strategic decisions


- themes and context
- cases and range, central tendency, distribution
- cultures and range, central tendency, distribution, details, context

### presentation


#### general and particular


- universal statements
- cross cultural assertions
- general statements about society or cultural group


#### core and periphery


- range
- central tendency
- distribution
- context


#### Style


- direct quotes
- paraphrases

## Live Q & A 1 Sep 2020

### Syllabus

- pick one skill or assignment and have that be the grade


### Notes

- critical response process; solicit maker feedback; https://lizlerman.com/critical-response-process/
- will adopt in this class; enthusiastic to try;
- have found that people are experiencing much distress and are less open to hear critical feedback
- in our role, we would be responder (maker, responder, facilitator)
- feedback sandwich compared to the feedback tostada
- coding, unspoken and underlying meanings, can be challenging to reliable coding

## Sandelowski, Margarete. “Writing a Good Read: Strategies for Re‐presenting Qualitative Data.” Research in Nursing & Health 21, no. 4 (August 1998): 375–382.

- there is no style for Qualitative reporting
- the representation should best fit the Research
- state the point, in one sentence
- how to balance description, analysis, and interpretation
- emphasize character scene or plot
- determine point of voice/voice
- understand and use metaphor well
- consider using time as an organizing primary or secondary principle
- time from the perspective of the research subject compared to the perspective of the researcher
- time related rhetorical devices, such as flash backs or flash forwards
- organize according to central tendencies and ranges


## Saldaña, Johnny. “Dramatizing Data: A Primer.” Qualitative inquiry 9, no. 2 (2016): 218–236.

- ethnotheatre as an appropriate choice for qualitative research
- plot is the overall structure of the play
- the story line is the sequential arrangement of units within the plot
- should have a beginning, middle, and end but not necessarily in that order
- reduction of field notes to salient foreground issues
- promote a three dimensional portrayal of the participant, from interviews, field notes, observations, research literature,
- interviews generate transcript data suitable for transformation into one person reflections.
- dialogue shows character interaction and interplay


# Week 3: Building and Applying Codebooks


## video lecture


### key terms


- codes; short hand notations for themes
- codebooks; organized lists and definitions of themes
- coding; act of linking themes to chunks


### Types of codes


- thematic; link themes with instances of data
- structural codes; describe characteristics of the data


### other markup tools


- memos; used to annotate text with running thoughts of analyst
- hyperlinks; link one instance of data to another
- tagging; indicate where themes occur in possibly overlapping text
- value coding; assign value to fixed non overlapping segments


### codebook development


- approach can be deductive, inductive, or both
- often but not always, organized hierarchically,
- can be defined as inclusive or exclusive
- code with a purpose;  bewar eof proliferation
- keeping codebooks to a manageable size helps accuracy and reliability


- code with your research question
- ultimately about data reduction into manageable size; less is more
- a grading rubric is an example of a codebook


coding schemes


- outline of cultural materials; gene shelley
- kuraski; first order, second order,
- handbook for team based qualitative research


### mnemonic


- short label
- short and detailed description
- inclusion and exclusion; features required?
- typical and atypical examples


### codebook definition structure


- important to help with the final product
