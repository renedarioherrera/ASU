- in our role, we would be responder (maker, responder, facilitator)
- feedback sandwich compared to the feedback tostada
- coding, unspoken and underlying meanings, can be challenging to reliable coding

- there is no style for Qualitative reporting
- the representation should best fit the Research
- state the point, in one sentence
- how to balance description, analysis, and interpretation
- emphasize character scene or plot
- determine point of voice/voice
- understand and use metaphor well
- consider using time as an organizing primary or secondary principle
- time from the perspective of the research subject compared to the perspective of the researcher
- time related rhetorical devices, such as flash backs or flash forwards
- organize according to central tendencies and ranges


## Saldaña, Johnny. “Dramatizing Data: A Primer.” Qualitative inquiry 9, no. 2 (2016): 218–236.

- ethnotheatre as an appropriate choice for qualitative research
- plot is the overall structure of the play
- the story line is the sequential arrangement of units within the plot
- should have a beginning, middle, and end but not necessarily in that order
- reduction of field notes to salient foreground issues
- promote a three dimensional portrayal of the participant, from interviews, field notes, observations, research literature,
- interviews generate transcript data suitable for transformation into one person reflections.
- dialogue shows character interaction and interplay
