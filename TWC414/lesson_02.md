## Storytelling with Data


### Introduction


1. Understand the context
2. Choose an appropriate visual display
3. Eliminate clutter
4. Focus attention where you want it
5. Think like a designer
6. Tell a story


### Chapter 1: The Importance of Context


#### Exploratory versus **explanatory** analysis

- Who
  - your audience: be specific, avoid "stakeholders"
  - you: what is my relationship to the audience
- what
  - action: what do i need my audience to know or do
  - mechanism: how will you communicate to your audience? live presentation? written document or email?  
  - tone: what tone do you want your communication to set?
- how: what data is available to help me make my point?


#### consulting for context:


- What background information is relevant or essential?
- Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know about them?
- What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message?
- What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new?
- Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?
- What would a successful outcome look like?
- If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?


#### the 3 minute story & big idea

  - 3 minute story: if you had only three minutes to present, what would you say?
  - big idea: a single sentence

#### Storyboarding:

- establishes a structure for your communication
- visual outline of the planned content
- on a physical medium not on a computer


### Chapter 7: Lessons in Storytelling


#### Storytelling and the written word


1. find a subject you care about
2. do not ramble
3. keep it simple
4. have the guts to cut
5. sound like yourself
6. say what you meant to say
7. pity the readers


#### The beginning

1. the setting
2. the main character
3. the imbalance
4. the balance
5. the solution

#### The middle

Write the headlines first


- further develop the situation or problem
- incorporate external content
- give examples
- include data that demonstrates the problem
- articulate what will happen if no action is taken
- discuss potential options
- illustrate the benefits of my recommended solution
- make it clear to audience why they are uniquely positioned to make a decision or drive action


#### The end

a call to action


#### Narrative flow


- the story must have an order and the order is dictated by the audience
- the flow is the path along which you take your audience
- the path should be clear to you
- options
  - chronological
  - lead with the ending


#### the spoken and written narrative

- a live presentation
- a written report


#### Tactics to ensure clarity


- horizontal logic: action titles that communicate the overarching story
- vertical logic: all information on a given slide is self-reinforcing. The content reinforces the title. The title reinforces the content.
- reverse storyboarding: take the final communication, flip through it, write down the main point from each page. The resulting list should look like the storyboard or outline for the story you want to tell.
- a fresh perspective

## Chapter 8: Creating Information Graphics


> Start with a strong focus, do as much research as you can, organize, summarize, and then deliver your conclusions in a structured and visually appealing manner.


1. define focus
2. gather information
3. choose the best graphic form
4. complete your research
5. think about visual style
6. if sketching on physical medium, move to the computer


Create structure and hierarchy in your composition by **organize into rectangles.**
