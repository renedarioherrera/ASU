# questions


question 1: describing themes;


- line by line is difficult and may not yield analytic categories as quickly
- the techniques describing memoing are advanced


question 2: problem


- design a semi structured protocol
- deductively determined
- then go back and code elicited data (example about discipline)
- not optimal because 1 - you put the idea into their head
- and 2 - there is no variability
- a semi structured protocol already frames the data
- the big point is to describe and theorize variability
- how then to use deductive or inductive codes to capture?
- inductive, use their own words to form categories
- deductive, put their words into predetermined existing categories
- for us to deduce narratives from the inductive perspective, the researcher must be linguistically and culturally competent
- aim for deductive variability; understand the data


question 3: why do some researchers lack qualitative competence


- quantitative analysis of qualitative data is limited in explaining the meaning of what people were saying
- although it is accurate and reliable
- in anthropology training, very often the training is to specified; and so the toolkit is too narrow to use effectively in a broad range of situations


question 4: coding assignment week 2


- theme tree;

## Chapter 6 of Analyzing Qualitative


### Three Kinds of Codes

1. structural: describe things like features of the environment in which data are collected, features of ther espondent, features of the interview, etc
2. thematic: show where the themes we've identified actually occur in text
3. memos: field notes about codes and contain our running commentary as we read through text

### Building codebooks


#### 5 step for developing themes inductively


1. reduce raw data
2. identify themes
3. compare themes
4. create codes
5. assess interrater reliability


#### 3 step for developing themes deductively

1. create a code
2. review the data and revise the code
3. assess interrater reliability


### Using Existing Codes


adapting from preexisting coding sources


### applying theme codes to text

3 meanings to the word code in English

1. code names and places to protect our respondents' anonymity
2. tag or index the text or to assign it values of a scale; themes as an index code or a tag
3. theme as a value code, for example no pain, low pain, mid, high.


### mechanics of marking text


1. start any text analysis project with pencil and paper methods; writing notes in the margins, highlighting chunks of text with different colors, and cutting and sorting multiple copies of notes and transcripts
2. do with a few pages or several interviews to get a feel of the data
3. as you write down each code on a first pass through a text, circle or highlight the exact chunk of text to which it refers


### using text analysis software


- for simple projects a word processor is all that is needed


### multiple coders


- intercoder reliability is vital if you're going to do statistical analysis on your data


### Training coders


1. give all coders a written codebook to which they can refer during the actual marking of data
2. after reviewing the codebook as a group, have coders independently code a set of real examples
3. review their respones and bring the group together to discuss and resolve discrepancies
4. update the codebook as coders come to agreements about the content of themes
5. once coders start coding the bulk of the data, do random spot checks to keep coders alert and to find out if they are running into situations that you had not anticipated in designing the codebook
6. if there are continued problems, repeat steps 3 & 4, if you make any changes, go back over previously coded m aterial to make sure it is all coded consistently


### how many coders are enough?


1. coders' experience / knowledge
2. core / periphery dispersion of the theme. clear core is easy.
3. level of inference required to see a theme. the more inference it takes the harder it is for two or more to agree that they see it in a text
4. number of times that any given theme appears in the text. more rare and more important the more coders needed to look for it.
5. consensus among coders about the presence of a theme


### Trimming codes and coders


reduce workload and cost by:


1. lowering the number of codes
2. reducing the amount of text to be coded
3. using fewer coders


### content of codebooks

key to good coding is a good codebook

1. mnemonic; explicit and in plain language
2. emic and etic themes;
3. short descriptions and detailed descriptions;
4. list of inclusion and exclusion criteria;
5. typical and atypical examples

### describing themes

provide an overview of the theme and core components.

### finding typical segments of text


use the pile sort method;
begin by retrieving all instance of a theme, cutting out the quotes, and writing some identifier on the back;
then sort them;


1. first spread out quotes on large table all mixed up
2. examine the quotes and identify those that seem to represent the core aspects of the theme then move it toward the middle of the table; once finished, core quotes at the center, peripheral out towards the edge
3. refine. sort core quotes into two groups 1- most representative and 2-less representative. then express in words the characteristics that distinguish between quotes in the strong and week core. this identifies primary and secondary components
4. sort periphery into groups based on similarity. make as many groups as necessary
5. select typical quotes or exemplars. select a couple that seem to best represent the group
6. with the quotes on the table sorted into core and periphery, turn each one over and examine who said it. this keeps you from using just one or two informants as the sources. if there is a pattern in the distribution you'll likely see it


## video lecture


### key terms


- codes; short hand notations for themes
- codebooks; organized lists and definitions of themes
- coding; act of linking themes to chunks


### Types of codes


- thematic; link themes with instances of data
- structural codes; describe characteristics of the data


### other markup tools


- memos; used to annotate text with running thoughts of analyst
- hyperlinks; link one instance of data to another
- tagging; indicate where themes occur in possibly overlapping text
- value coding; assign value to fixed non overlapping segments


### codebook development


- approach can be deductive, inductive, or both
- often but not always, organized hierarchically,
- can be defined as inclusive or exclusive
- code with a purpose;  bewar eof proliferation
- keeping codebooks to a manageable size helps accuracy and reliability


- code with your research question
- ultimately about data reduction into manageable size; less is more
- a grading rubric is an example of a codebook


coding schemes


- outline of cultural materials; gene shelley
- kuraski; first order, second order,
- handbook for team based qualitative research


### mnemonic


- short label
- short and detailed description
- inclusion and exclusion; features required?
- typical and atypical examples


### codebook definition structure


- important to help with the final product

ASU ASB 500 Module 1 Week 3:

Building and applying codebooks video 3 working with multiple coders


5 benefits


- reliability: agreement among coders indicates which codes are instruments, apply the data in the same way
- validity; defends trustworthiness of analysis, can defined in ways that are meaningful to others,
- theme definition; clarify meaning and establish inclusion and exclusion criteria


video 4: measuring intercoder reliability


- percent agreement; cohen's kappa: measures agreement beyond chance
- calculate with a coder by coder agreement matrix
- kappa = (p1 - p2) / (1-p2)
- report kappa calculation for each code in codebook,
- report confidence intervals and standard error along with kappa statistic
- kappa ranges from -1 to 1
- preferred to see kappa >= .8
- "kappa calculator" such as graphpad quick calcs


- assessing intercoder reliability early is a strategy to identify problems with coder training or with conceptual clarity of codebook
- later it demonstrates final agreement


how many codes?

- be aware of code creep
- build codebooks for what you need
- limit codes to what fits on a single page
- 30-50 codes is usually about right


how many levels?

- maybe no more than 3, or 5


- codebooks specify project level coding instructions
- how to code, who to code, what to code, where to code


summary

- coding is heart and soul of text analysis
- structured codebook is key to systematic analysis
- using multiple coders improves validity and identifies core periphery structures

codebook structure:

five parts to codebook:

1. code mnemonic
2. brief definition
3. full definition of inclusion criteria
4. full definition of exclusion criteria to explain how the code differed from others
5. example passages that illustrated how the code concept might appear in natural language


6 components to a codebook:


1. the code
2. brief definition
3. full definition
4. guidelines for when to use the code
5. guidelines for when not to use the code
6. examples


a relational database is well suited for both maintaining the structure and supporting the process
