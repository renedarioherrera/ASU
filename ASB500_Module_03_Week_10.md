# Week 10: Classical Content Analysis


## Fundamentals of Word Based Analysis

#### convert text into words

1. eliminate common (analytically insignificant) words
2. make stop list
3. or adopt existing stop list (example: english stop list)
4. create and use stop lists
5. run word frequency to identify other stop list words

#### convert words into counts

1. word by respondent matrix
2. either counts or binary (yes/no the word is present)

Is there an analytically significant difference between the number of times a word is used or whether or not the word is used at all

### making comparisons

- for example, use of the ". " (period and space) as a delimiter to identify the unit of analysis
- standardize the unit of comparison

### make predictions

- NA

### key words in context (KWIC)

- sentence level or paragraph level context
- can present findings as both quantitative and qualitative comparison
- presenting keyword in linguistic context 


## Video Lesson 1


1. methodological challenges in deductive, code based approaches
2. evaluate empirical applications


- Code based analysis


workflow:


1. theory and rational
2. conceptualizations
3. operationalizations
4. human (codebook) OR computer coding (content dictionary)
5. sampling
6. training and pilot reliability
7. coding
8. final reliability
9. tabulation and reporting


## Video Lesson 2


### Sampling


- two step process
- identify corpus of text
- complete corpus or sample?
- probability or nonprobability sample?


stratified probability sampling design


- sampling from the unit of analysis


stratified nonprobability sampling


- collapsing variables into binary choices
- fill cells with x cases to yield sample


segmenting text into units of analysis


- whole text?
- smaller segments?
- what's the question?
- if goal is to compare across texts, larger unit?


## Video Lesson 3


- classical content > codes developed from theory (deductive) > codebook
- exploratory > codes developed inductively > codebook


### example coding scheme


1. sample
2. pretest coding scheme
3. assign to two independent coders
4. measure reliability
5. test for differences by gender


## Video Lesson 4


- structured codebook definition?
- routine but uncritical use of race and ethnicity


## Video Lesson 5


- ..


## Live session


- presentation?
- orient toward presentation
- expectations for workshop
- complete one assignment: presentation, assignment, final paper
- send email to notify which assignment
- state which should be chosen for grading
- participation grade on syllabus


### Workshop


get feedback on work wherever it is in development for example


- you may have no idea about a project; I'm working on, ... , what kind of data / sample / analysis
- I have this data, what can I do; data problem solving
- in the middle of analysis but stuck somewhere
- just about complete, where can I submit for publication
- limit to no more than 15 minutes; 2-3 minutes presentation and then 7 minutes of discussion and feedback
- I am scheduled to present 3 Nov 2020
- but don't stress;
