# Week 8: Grounded Theory


## Grounded Theory

- Grounded theory was originally developed in sociology by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss (1967)
- purpose was to construct middle-range theories to explain behavior and process.
- emphasized that empirical fieldwork could actually help generate substantive theory.
- challenged the separation of data collection and analytic phases of the research. In fact, in grounded theory these two phases are explicitly designed to be iterative, feeding off of each other.  
- tends to flourish particularly in those scholarly disciplines that have a real commitment to understanding how the people they study conceptualize and navigate the world.
- you really can’t be doing orthodox grounded theory unless you are either hewing closely to the methods that it lays out or making some kind of explicit statement about why you’re not hewing to those methods (why you’re violating the assumptions).
- important to realize that you can borrow techniques from grounded theory.

### Traditions in Grounded Theory: Glaser

- Glaser contended that grounded theorists should have absolutely no exposure to any outside theoretical materials before starting the study.
- grounded theory studies should only be induced or the findings should only be induced from the data themselves.
- how do you get funding for field research when you have no theoretical contributions that you can discuss in any way that your study might make?

### Traditions in Grounded Theory: Corbin & Straus

- Corbin and Strauss have a more hybridized approach to grounded theory that allows some knowledge of prior theoretical categories,
- but then makes some efforts to develop reflexivity and ensure that the analyst is setting those theoretical categories aside and allowing the data to speak to form the grounded theory analysis itself.

### Traditions in Grounded Theory: Charmaz

- questions the built-in assumptions about the nature of the data and its meaning

### Techniques of Grounded Theory

- Simultaneous involvement in data collection and analysis
- Developing analytic codes and categories from data, not prior theory
- Memo-writing to fill out analytic categories and develop theory
- Making comparisons between data and data, data and concept, concept and concept
- Sampling for theory construction and to check and refine conceptual categories
- Delaying the literature review until after the analysis

### Process of Grounded Theory

1. Pick a focus
2. Collect relevant data
3. Identify important themes
    - Types of coding
        - Open coding
        - In vivo coding
        - Constant comparison
        - Memo-writing
    - General suggestions
        - Do your own coding (i.e., research assistants are less productive here)
        - Always interrupt coding to memo an idea
        - Stay within the confines of the substantive area and field study
4. Develop and apply codebook
    - Pull examples & check each theme’s coherence
    - Look for potential subthemes
5. Collect more data (Theoretical Sampling)
    - Develop dialogue between data and analysis
    - As theory develops, used more focused methods of observation
    - Secondary sampling
        - Focus on the contribution of new sites to theoretical development
        - Select sites for comparison not cases for representativeness
        - Select for conceptual variation across different sites
    - Stop collecting data when they no longer produce significant conceptual variations (“theoretical saturation”)
6. Build models and theories by identifying relationships among themes (Axial Coding)
    - Develop integrative hypotheses about the relations between categories and their properties
    - Identify a “core” category or main “story line” for the study
    - Integrate the analysis around this framework
    - Use memos and coded data to amplify and modify the resulting analysis
    - Stop when an adequate theory has emerged
7. Model checking
    - Negative case analysis
    - Theoretical sampling
    - Critical checks
        - Informants (emic)
        - Colleagues (etic)
        - Devil’s advocate

### Theoretical Approach

Researcher's critical reflection throughout process of:

- minimalist a priori constructs
- inquiry into practice
- gradual formation of theory
- generalization

### Data Collection 1

multiple source interviews input (or in depth narrative)

Researcher's critical reflection throughout process of:

- minimalist a priori constructs
- inquiry into practice
- gradual formation of theory
- generalization

### theoretical sampling 1

- Criterion sampling: Selecting cases that “meet some predetermined criterion of importance”
- Snowball sampling: Identifying cases from “people who know people who know people who know what cases are information-rich”
- Maximum variation sampling: Selecting participants for “capturing and describing central themes . . . that cut across a great deal of participant . . . variation”

### line by line (open) coding

- fine tuned approache that doesn't yield large categories or themes
- taking the raw data and just starting to barely analyze it into sub-themes.

### in vivo coding

- using either indigenous categories
- or the respondent’s own words to identify initial categories or sub-themes.

### theoretical sampling 2

- also included qualitative research reports

### Data Collection 2

- ethnography,
- field notes,
- longitudinal case studies,
- observation or focal follows,
- focus groups or social constructionist workshops,
- and studies of existing records or archives.
-  be really creative about where the additional data comes from.

### line by line (open) coding

- go back to your process of line-by-line coding analyzing those data line-by-line and
- creating your initial sub-themes.

### in vivo coding

- do this again and again until you reach theoretical saturation—you’re not generating any new sub-themes.
- quite important in orthodox grounded theory to make sure that you transcribe and analyze the first interview or the first set of data before going on to the second one.
- not meant to analyze all data at once
- the process is iterative for each sample

### creating a codebook

- can start to create that first nascent codebook that begins to sort of capture your first cut at the data and your first sense of those emerging themes and categories.
- capture understanding of data
- first sense of categories
- catpured in memos

### theoretical sampling 3

- Intensity sampling: Selecting “information-rich cases that manifest the phenomenon intensely . . .” (p. 171),
- Typical case sampling: Selecting cases that “illustrate or highlight what is typical, normal, or average”
(p. 182),
- Extreme or deviant case sampling: Selecting cases that are “rich in information because they are unusual or special in some way” (p. 169),
- Stratified purposeful sampling: Selecting cases that “illustrate characteristics of certain subgroups” (p. 182), and
- Theory-based or operational construct sampling: Selecting cases that manifest “theoretical constructs of interest” (p. 183).

### constant comparison and/or axial coding

-  indentifying increasingly larger categories and using these constant comparisons to start to get a nascent (emerging) sense of the connections among those categories.

### memo writing

- identifies a metaphor and
- then documents the researcher’s sort of epiphanies about the meaning of the metaphor in the context
- designed to be a really focal and highly important aspect of the process that’s used to guide the literature review—everything from the beginning of the process to guiding the selection of respondents to facilitating coding and epiphanies and an emerging sense of the grounded theory to facilitating literature review at the back end of the research

### theoretical sampling 4

two-stage approach looking at a macro level of how you would go through theoretical sampling.

#### data collection and earl analysis

- a theoretical sampling approach on the left hand side of going through 50 participants.
- then taking an additional stratified random sample to ensure that they’ve met theoretical saturation,
- then finally two participants to help them induce this tentative model.

#### final detailed analysis

- then in a final detailed analysis they might go through 50 participants
- then perhaps select two extreme or deviant cases at this fourth stage of theoretical sampling to test the emerging model.
- then finally use 10 participants at the end to test the findings and confirm that there is a usable theory there.

### constant comparison and/or axial coding third refinement

- after fourth round of sampling
- start to think about emerging understanding of model

### theoretical sampling 5

- using confirming and disconfirming case sampling in terms of selecting cases for the purpose of elaborating and deepening the initial analysis, seeking exceptions, and testing variation
- Confirming and disconfirming case sampling: “Selecting cases for the purpose of elaborating and deepening initial analysis, seeking exceptions, testing variation.”

### Grounded Theory Process

- start with a general, theoretical perspective.
- some research problems and questions and
- go through iterative stages of data collection,
- memo writing,
- more data collection,
- focus coding,
- theoretical sampling,
- sorting of memos,
- integrating of memos,
- more coding and comparison,
- and then finally writing up the draft.
- And then you can see at the end you may even need, after writing the first draft, to go through further theoretical sampling to ensure that the model is sufficiently refined

#### typologies

- contributions that identify and describe key categories
- analysis yields a series of different ethnographically derived categories
- Some concentrate on inducing categories, or a typology, from narrative data

#### models

- go further in building and presenting models that describe both the categories and the linkages among them
- present a model detailing the connections among a set of concepts

#### comparisons

- compare differences in models across groups
- conduct comparative analyses that seek to identify or explain differences in models across groups

#### predictions

- about who holds the models or how models impact behavior
