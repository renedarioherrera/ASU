# Week 7: Schema Analysis


# Traditions of text analysis

- Schema analysis is based on the idea that people use shortcuts or simplifications in their thinking to help them deal with the complexities of reality. Cultural schemas comprise shared rules for interpersonal behavior—rules that provide the kind of flexibility that allow for immediate changes of response as people respond to each other’s actions. So the purpose of schema analysis is to induce and identify these schemas or shared rules. And we will discuss how scheme analysis can be used theoretically, but certainly, at the earliest stages, the focus is on exploration and description.
- to identify a set of rules for imposing order on experience
- inductive to deductive
- exploratory

### schema analysis

- what goes with what schemes
- what happens when schemes
- cultural schema; shared schema
- comedy is based on cultural schemas

### step 1 finding constructs and associated links

- repetition: words, phrases, ideas, simplest and most direct sign
- patterns of speech
- commonalities in reasoning
- metaphors and analogies
- what is not said; when people tell stories they leave out information everybody already knows

### step 2; narrow down key constructs

- mentioned most frequently
- underlying reasoning
- iterative analysis; breaking all of the narratives into smaller constructs. And then, iteratively going back through those small constructs or sub-themes, if you will, trying to group them, compare and contrast them until you can recognize larger and larger key constructs
- metacoding; identify specific classes and sub-classes of themes or constructs, by then metacoding them and purposefully grouping them into larger and larger themes and constructs you may be able to identify a few key, focal ones. And just as it’s important to identify key constructs, it’s also important to sort and sift among the many associative links that you might identify in preliminary stages of an analysis and refine those down to the key associative links.

### step 3: link key constructs into a model

- identify key associative links
- assess: directionality, conditionality, causality
- determine; what goes with what, what happens when, what causes what

### example: schema analysis of marriage

- marriage as a manufactured product
- marriages that last and work like well made built to last products
- lay out a series of propositions to be able to understand and test
- thick description to describe model presentation
- when a model is presented this way work must be put in to depackage the model
- conformity of real world behavior to cultural model
- schema induces model then tested deductively

### analytic goals in schema analysis

- description
- comparison
- prediction of outcomes

#### description

- cultural consensus analysis assesses for shared knowledge, belief, and overarching cultural domain
- combinging schema analysis and cultural consensus anslysis

#### comparison

- the comprehension of a story would depend on its assimilation to the storytelling schemata of the hearer.

#### prediction of outcomes

- case schema analysis provides a powerful approach to determine how people think and where this thinking comes from and what happens when someone thinks differently
- example of predicting outcomes based on conformity to a schema.


# traditions of analysis; inductive; schema


- what are the reasons to compel NSF to invest in a study
- 1. concept of phenomenon is not well known
- difficult to take in explicitly inductive research and get grant funding
- 2. not enough literature to build off of, inadequate literature backing
- research question; as a model;
- what is the research question for an inductive study
- if i was doing inductive study what would the research study be
- what is this experience about,
- what is this phenomenon
- and so it is not a compelling question, when in competition with other questions for funding
- 3. questions are too poorly formed to be compelling
- respond to critique by; make compelling argument about why this case may add to what is already known; hitting really hard on the idea that this has not been well explored
- not common for professionals and intellectuals to question the values of the field
- inadequate because of unequal access to theory formation; implications then for what is unknown,
- weird argument; western educated industrial r democratic

- quantitative analysis; factor analysis; data mining; semantic network analysis;
- funded research has to do something important
- come to inductive research, already informed by the literature; most important
