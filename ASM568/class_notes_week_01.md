## Readings

### Ch2: The Spatial Database


Wheatley, David, and Mark Gillings. 2002. Spatial Technology and Archaeology: The Archaeological Applications of GIS. New York: Taylor & Francis.


- spatial database
    - location: a record of position in geographic space that determines where something is and what form it takes
    - topological: a record of the logical relationships between different geographic objects
    - attribute: a record of the characterists of things that determines what geographic objects represent and what properties they have
    - metadata: through documentation of the contents of the overall database
- vector systems: enable features to be represented using points, lines, areas, and provide a flexible link to related databases of attribute information
- raster: consistent grid based mechnanism for the  recording of attributes over space


## Ch2: First Principles


Conolly, James, and Mark Lake. 2006. Geographical Information Systems in Archaeology. Cambridge Manuals in Archaeology. Cambridge, UK ; New York: Cambridge University Press.


- 5 main groups of GIS:
    1. data acquisition
    2. spatial data management
    3. database management
    4. spatial data visualization
    5. spatial data analysis
- thematic maps: specific information about a single feature of the landscape or environment
    - or display information about a single subject
