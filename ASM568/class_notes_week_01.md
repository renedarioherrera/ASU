# ASU ASM 568: Week 1

## Readings 

### The Spatial Database 

- spatial database 
    - location: a record of position in geographic space that determines where something is and what form it takes
    - topological: a record of the logical relationships between different geographic objects
    - attribute: a record of the characterists of things that determines what geographic objects represent and what properties they have
    - metadata: through documentation of the contents of the overall database 
- vector systems: enable features to be represented using points, lines, areas, and provide a flexible link to related databases of attribute information 
- raster: consistent grid based mechnanism for the  recording of attributes over space 


## First Principles 


- 5 main groups of GIS:
    1. data acquisition 
    2. spatial data management 
    3. database management 
    4. spatial data visualization
    5. spatial data analysis 
- thematic maps: specific information about a single feature of the landscape or environment 
    - or display information about a single subject

- how to build geospatial models of past landscapes combining social and environmental variables
- address data bias, uncertainty, limitations 
- think not of GIS as a tool or product but instead GIS as a process 
- human space relationship
