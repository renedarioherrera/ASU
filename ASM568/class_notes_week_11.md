# Readings 


## Gradiometry Survey 


Rego, Justin P., and Wendy H. Cegielski. 2014. “Gradiometry Survey and Magnetic Anomaly Testing of Castros de Neixón, Galicia, Spain.” Journal of Archaeological Science 46 (June): 417–27. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2014.01.023.


### gradiometry 


- specialized form of magnetometry that employs a magnetometer with sensor 
- distribution of Archaeological features across the landscape


### goals


1. define the extent & nature of activity areas at the site 
2. categorize anamolies based on magnetic amplitude in order to make interpretation 
3. evaluate suitability of magnetic survey for identifying Archaeological features 


### magnetometry can find:


1. human induced firing 
2. constructiion with fired materials 
3. human construction 
4. human imported stone 
5. iron artifacts 


### methods: data processing 


1. clip data 
2. "zero means traverse" 
3. despike 


## Integrated Geophysical Investigations 


Scudero, Salvatore, Raffaele Martorana, Patrizia Capizzi, Antonino Pisciotta, Antonino D’Alessandro, Carla Bottari, and Giovanni Di Stefano. 2018. “Integrated Geophysical Investigations at the Greek Kamarina Site (Southern Sicily, Italy).” Surveys in Geophysics 39 (6): 1181–1200. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-018-9483-1.


### methods:


- serial photographic survey -> digital surface model (DSM) 
- UAV photogrammetry and structure from motion 


### aerial photographic and thermographic survey 


- and thermal imagery 


# Class Notes 


Geophysical survey


## Archaeological geophysics:


Near surface minimally invasive techniques


### Ground penetrating radar 


- slices can be arranged to produce pseudo 3D images (3D rendering)


### Magnetic gradiometry 


- workforce of geophysical survey 
- magnetic contrast between natural background and Archaeological artifacts 


### Electrical resistivity


- can be used to discriminate depth 


### Magnetic susceptivity 


Image the shallow subsurface, ~5m but up to 10m


### tomography 


3D rendering 


## When is Geophysical survey appropriate 


- for informed targeted survey & mapping of area of interest 
- understand subsurface features 
- less expensive and define site stratigraphy


## goals of geophysical survey 


- distinguish physical properties of Archaeological anamolies from other 


## fundamentals of image processing 


NA 


## Digital image processing 


1. pre-processing 
2. image analysis 
3. interpretation
