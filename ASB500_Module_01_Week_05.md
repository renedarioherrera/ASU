# Week 5: models


- typically people come to qual analysis is to create a model
- any research can be phrased as a research question
- exploratory model, what are the distinguishing characteristics of the question
- Or confirmatory?
- "how does this model play out"
- but hypotheses, found only in confirmatory, is a model because ...
- a research question is a model because it lays out relationship for a set of relationships
- research question, hypotheses, model, description are all the same
- the preceeding vary in stylization of phenomenon
- to demystify, must think about theory building in this way
- theorizing is a plebian activity, that every single person does, every person has a schema, a way of knowing how the world works
- theorizing is not an elite activity


# questions about models, research questions, hypotheses?


## how questions ask about processual models; what's the process? need longitudinal data, research data over time?


- must then plan on collecting longitudinal data
- alternative to processual/causality, mus
- if you're doing methods, then you must have a question
- different methodological approaches have inherent assumptions
- it is important to understand how to formulate a research questions
- a research question is a model where every single word works
- *in my example, of LTBC webinar research,*
- look to take class, ethnographic field methods?
- research design is like a puzzle, every piece must fit


## data mining


- is an exploratory activity
- be explicit about what you are doing with data mining
- but p value hacking the data to find a significant association should be avoided
- preceeding, is data misconduct
-
