# Week 5: Building and Testing Models


- model is a set of constructs and linkages beween them
- similiarties and differences between constructs

### scope of a model

- particular; narrow and specific
- general; wide range of ideas
- confirmatory research tests the model
- model is a vehicle for a theoretical contribution
- distinction maps onto ideographic theories

### concepts models contain

- themes
- structural codes; Structural codes are a concept and they basically refer to aspects of the respondent or of the data themselves that aren’t coded thematically but are relevant to the analysis
- variables


### linkages models contain

- deterministic; if this happens then this must happen
- temporal; first this then this
- semantic;
- probabilistic; identify likely relationships or tendencies and co-occurrence

### how we build models

1. identify constructs; Now, if you are taking a highly inductive approach you would identify those constructs by doing a series of theme identification exercises grounded in the data. However, if you are taking a highly confirmatory approach you would want to identify all of the relevant constructs by working through the literature and seeing what are all of the key variables or key aspects of a situation that prior scholars have suggested would be relevant to what you’re studying.
2. identify key constructs; on the exploratory side we discussed in the identifying themes lecture how you would select among the themes that you induced the most important ones. Of course, in interacting with the literature you may choose to focus on a subset of constructs based on their potential contribution to the literature in the future, based on those that are most relevant to the context in which you are working, or based on the salience of those constructs across the literature.
3. link key constructs;

### how to display models

- thick description; word-based discussion or description of the model
- concept maps; include boxes and arrows if the suggested linkages between the concepts depicted by the boxes are directional. If they are undirectional, the boxes or concepts might be connected by lines rather than arrows
- charts and graphs; Charts and graphs might visually depict or display these relationship
- tables; used to posit or suggest pair wise relationships. But we will go through a number of examples that explore each of these

### thick description

- most common way to display qualititative concepts and linkages

### concept map

- deterministic relationships
- identify concepts and linkages
- missing nuance and context compared to thick description

### tables and concept maps

- table is good for giving us the exact breakdown of where each of these categories falls in terms of the categories
- gives us a more holistic sense of the model

### mental maps

- multidimensional scaling
- what is more similar

### semantic map

- exploratory
- descriptive

### activity

- temporal; processual linkages

### transition

- linkages show transition and are qualitative

### contextual model

- one of the positive aspects of this model is that it does allow for a lot of complexity to be displayed visually, and one of the things I like about it is that it can help get us thinking about how to display very complex and multi-layered models visually rather than just as thick description. However, one of the drawbacks is the more complexity you add to the contextual model, first of all, the more difficult it is to get detail displayed and secondly, the more difficult it becomes to read the model

### process model

- temporal
- could be used either to depict a particular event or a more general class of events. And it does seem to me that in addition to facilitating exploration and description, this model could certainly be used for comparison and prediction as well. So this is a model that is quite simple, but actually seems to do a lot of work in terms of being able to clearly depict concepts and linkages, be used for general or particular cases, and be used for an entire range of theoretical contributions. But, in fact, there are ways to look at this model that could be more complex. So, for instance, this is a concept map with boxes and arrows, but we could add to it a table.
- hybrid kind of model display that uses a concept map and a table to facilitate comparisons and predictions. Again, probably the main drawback of this is that it does start to become quite complex, but I think that compared to some very complex models this one is relatively easy to navigate

### interactive event model

- designed to model the interaction between two actors, whether a person, a community, a city, around an event.
- add in information about behaviors, thoughts, emotion, and the physical and social environment. And so by adding again this table to a conceptual map we add the ability to do comparisons and perhaps facilitate the ability to assess predictions

### decision making model

- processual
- temporal
- iterative steps forward and backward
- deterministic
- describes cases
- social decision making model
- describes patterns

### regression model

- quantitative coded information
- facilitates comparison and prediction
- inaccessible

### testing models

- negative case analysis; doing systematic comparisons between an emerging model and new cases that seem to disconfirm it negative case analysis is designed to either force a revision of a qualitative model or to make clear why specific instances of data or respondents fall outside of the target sample.
- regression analysis
- model validation; emic model validation that deals with the views of people within a society or within a way of thinking within the target population about whether the model conforms to how they think. Or they can be etic model validation techniques in which you go to other theoretical experts in your area and ask if they think that the model has done a good job of summarizing the way that ideas or concepts should be linked together. And so, clearly, on the more inductive side of theoretical contribution, emic model validation approaches will be quite important. And on the more confirmatory side of theoretical contribution, etic model validation approaches will be quite important. However, this issue of how we test models will be something that we address more thoroughly again and again as we start the lectures on specific theoretical traditions in qualitative analysis


- typically people come to qual analysis is to create a model
- any research can be phrased as a research question
- exploratory model, what are the distinguishing characteristics of the question
- Or confirmatory?
- "how does this model play out"
- but hypotheses, found only in confirmatory, is a model because ...
- a research question is a model because it lays out relationship for a set of relationships
- research question, hypotheses, model, description are all the same
- the preceeding vary in stylization of phenomenon
- to demystify, must think about theory building in this way
- theorizing is a plebian activity, that every single person does, every person has a schema, a way of knowing how the world works
- theorizing is not an elite activity


# questions about models, research questions, hypotheses?


## how questions ask about processual models; what's the process? need longitudinal data, research data over time?


- must then plan on collecting longitudinal data
- alternative to processual/causality, mus
- if you're doing methods, then you must have a question
- different methodological approaches have inherent assumptions
- it is important to understand how to formulate a research questions
- a research question is a model where every single word works
- *in my example, of LTBC webinar research,*
- look to take class, ethnographic field methods?
- research design is like a puzzle, every piece must fit


## data mining


- is an exploratory activity
- be explicit about what you are doing with data mining
- but p value hacking the data to find a significant association should be avoided
- preceeding, is data misconduct
-
